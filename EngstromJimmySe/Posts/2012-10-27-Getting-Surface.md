<p>Yesterday we went to the MS Store in Bellevue to (hopefully) pick up a Microsoft Surface, apparently so did the rest of Seattle too.<br />There where two lines, one to get into the store, and one to get into the line to get into the store.Four hours later we finally got in and *drumroll* got a Surface.<br />Finally decided to get a 32GB version&nbsp;with type cover but I changed my mind several times while waiting in line.<br /><br /><br />Here are some pictures =)</p>
