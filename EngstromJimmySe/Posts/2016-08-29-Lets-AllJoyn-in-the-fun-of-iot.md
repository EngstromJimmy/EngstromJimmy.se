There are billions of IoT Devices and almost as many ways to communicate with them. 
Alljoyn is a standardized way to talk to IoT devices. 
With the help of this standard the devices themself can tell you about and expose what functionality you can use.
All these things are implemented in Windows 10, we will look at how you can find devices, how to communicate with them and how AllJoyn works.
