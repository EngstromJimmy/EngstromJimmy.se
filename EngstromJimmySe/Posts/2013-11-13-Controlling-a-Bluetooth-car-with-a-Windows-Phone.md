<p>Last Christmas my mother-in-law gave me a <a href="http://silverlit.com/toy/interactive-bluetooth-rc-458-italia-for-android">Bluetooth controlled car</a>.<br>These kind of gifts are the best for a developer like me, its a toy/gadget and there is no app for Windows Phone which means I just got a gadget AND a development project.<br>I have been in contact with Silverlit (the company that manufacture the car) who sadly decided not to take my offer of developing their app/API for free, and also didn't supply me with any details regarding the protocol (I guess they where short of resources).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Challenge accepted.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After a couple of weeks I managed to figure out the protocol <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Open-mouthed smile" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_1.png">.<br>Now I have an API for the car ready but I would like Silverlits permission to release it before I do so.<br>I am also working on making the API available for Windows 8.1.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:a1cbeeb9-0301-4011-b9bd-4a1643902700" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" style="float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px"><div><object width="448" height="252"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HM6qS7_RcA8?hl=en&amp;hd=1"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HM6qS7_RcA8?hl=en&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="448" height="252"></embed></object></div><div style="width:448px;clear:both;font-size:.8em">Me contorolling a Silverlit Ferrari 458 Italia with my Windows Phone</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Currently Silverlit isn't returning my emails, not sure why (could be that the contacts I had doesn't work there anymore).<br>If you know a good contact at Silverlit please let me know, I really would like to release this API so that more developers will be able to develop for this BT car because it is really awesome.</p>
