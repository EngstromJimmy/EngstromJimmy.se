I've got some SUPER exciting news for all you code enthusiasts out there ‚Äì my book, "Web Development with Blazor," has finally hit the shelves and is ready to rock your web development world! ü•≥

This new edition is updated from .NET 5 to .NET 7.  
There are a couple of completely new chapters covering Blazor Hybrid (with .NET MAUI), a look at Source Generators and a deeper look into Blazor WebAssembly specific things amongst others things.  

This labor of love is packed with all the Blazor goodness you need, whether you're a fresh-faced newbie looking to dip your toes into web development or a seasoned pro seeking to level up your Blazor mastery. And guess what? It's the only Blazor book with raccoons on the cover, which of course is important! ü¶ù

You'll get hands-on experience with Blazor, diving deep into the world of web development, and most importantly, having a blast along the way! Plus, the book doubles as a trusty reference guide for all your future Blazor escapades.

In case we haven't met yet, I'm Jimmy Engstr√∂m, a Microsoft MVP and Blazor fan who's been running Blazor in production since 2019. When I'm not crafting books or tinkering with Blazor projects, you can catch me on my Twitch / YouTube channel, CodingAfterWork, live-streaming coding shenanigans and hanging out with the coolest developer community around. üòé

So, what are you waiting for? It's time to unleash your inner Blazor superhero and join forces with our raccoon friends! Grab your copy of "Web Development with Blazor" today and let's conquer the Blazor universe together!
