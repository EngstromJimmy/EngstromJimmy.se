<p>Been working on my ZX Spectrum emulator this weekend, delivering a new game to Elite.</p>  <p>Since it i s written in XNA I wanted to se if I could use that knowledge to make a game for Windows 8 (Metro).</p>  <p>As you may or may not know XNA is not supported in Windows 8 Metro, so I had to look for alternatives.</p>  <p>One solution is of course redo the emulator in Xaml which is probably the most logical solution since that only require minor changes in my case.</p>  <p>I however is not a vulcan and I choose to take the opportunity to check out Monogame =)</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Setup</h2>  <p>No real challenge here just download the installer from    <br /><a title="http://monogame.codeplex.com/" href="http://monogame.codeplex.com/">http://monogame.codeplex.com/</a></p>  <p>I chose to go with the installer instead of the Source code, I felt it would save me from unnecessary complexitivity.</p>  <p>Run the setup package and you are good to go.</p>
