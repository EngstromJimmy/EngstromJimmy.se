I am an international speaker, I have spoken at various developer conferences around the world including NDC (Oslo and Sydney), TechDays (Sweden and Finland), Techorama, Microsoft Ignite and many more.
I love sharing knowledge and I take every opportunity I can to make that happen.
Presentation skills are something I am very passionate about and I coach speakers in becoming better speakers.
