# Speaker
I am an international speaker, I have spoken at various developer conferences around the world including NDC (Oslo and Sydney), TechDays (Sweden and Finland), Techorama, Microsoft Ignite and many more.
I love sharing knowledge and I take every opportunity I can to make that happen.
Presentation skills are something I am very passionate about and I coach speakers in becoming better speakers.


## Bio

Ever since Jimmy got his first ZX Spectrum at the age of 7 he hasn't stopped programming.  
During the day he is a .NET developer and he does all the fun stuff during his spare time.  
Together with his wife he also runs a company "azm dev" which is focused on HoloLens and Windows development.  
He is passionate about Windows development, HoloLens or well you could say the .NET platform.  
He and his wife (Jessica) also runs a code-intensive user group (Coding After Work) that focuses on helping participants with code and design problems and a podcast with the same name.  
Back in 2011, he received the "geek of the year" award, a title well deserved.  
He is certainly living up to the title with everything from developing and gadgets to superheroes and cosplay at the sci-fi fair.  
He speaks at various types of events including NDC, Devsum, hackathons, Swetugg and TechDays which led to him becoming a Microsoft MVP in Windows Development.
