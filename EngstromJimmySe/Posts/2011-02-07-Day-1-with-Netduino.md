<p>My wife gave me a Netduino for my birthday, I don&rsquo;t have any experience with .net micro framework so this is going to be a whole new thing for me.</p>
<p>I wanted to start of easy, so I dug up an old LCD display (bought ten of them a couple of years ago but never got around to use them).</p>
<p>Found Pete Browns <a href="http://10rem.net/blog/2010/09/24/using-a-4x20-hd44780-controlled-lcd-display-with-the-netduino">blog post</a> about how to hook up an LCD&nbsp; display to a Netduino, luckily it was a HD44780-controlled just like the one Pete used in his blog post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing all the necessary <a href="http://netduino.com/downloads/">software</a> I started to connect the display to the Netduino.</p>
<p>It took me about 30 min from start to &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I Just love how easy it is to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first thought was to make this blog post a tutorial on how to hook up a LCD to a Netduino but since Pete&rsquo;s blog post was really great, no need to reinvent the wheel.</p>
