<p>The time is 6:30 a.m. still a bit jet lagged I guess, but lets be honest this kind of jet lag is good =D.</p>
<p>Waking up early and feeling great, I just love going to the states.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is registration day, still nothing revealed about the schedule, I hope we can rename this day as scheduling day after the registration, would be great to have some time to make plans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day in San Francisco, we went down to Pier 39, took a couple of pictures of Alcatraz and a foggy Golden gate bridge.</p>

<p>Then we went to 7D experience, if you visit San Francisco you really should go there.</p>

<p>Motion seats, wind, 3D AND shooting, pure awesomeness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also visited the arcade (next to the 7D Experience) my arm is a bit tender today after a tough shuffle puck <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">game</span>&nbsp; full out war with @pihlen.</p>
