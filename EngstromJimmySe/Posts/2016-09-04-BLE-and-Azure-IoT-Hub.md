The market totally explodes with new gadgets that can connect to tablets, pc's and phones. 
In 2015 alone there were 3 billion Bluetooth devices manufactured.
In this session I will show how you can take advantage of that and how to communicate with devices that are Bluetooth enabled. 
I will also show how to figure out undocumented devices and how to use Azure IoT hub to turn them into IoT devices.
