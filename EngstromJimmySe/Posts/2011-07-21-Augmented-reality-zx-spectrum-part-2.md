<p>In my <a href="http://apeoholic.se/post/Augmented-reality-zx-spectrum.aspx">last augmented reality</a> demo I showed a 3d model of a ZX Spectrum that appeared on a marker.</p>
<p>I got a few request on sharing the source so I cleaned up the code a little bit and <a href="http://apeoholic.se/post/Augmented-Reality-demo-with-SilverlightXNA.aspx">posted the source</a> for a version of that demo.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s face it a 3d model on a piece of paper is cool but is there a way to make it even more exciting?</p>
<p>As you may or may not know I&rsquo;m working on a ZX Spectrum emulator for Windows phone 7 and my goal is to have it ready very close to the mango release.</p>
<p>Perhaps integrate the two? How about an augmented reality ZX Spectrum emulator?</p>

<p>What amazes me is the performance of these phones, I have the Samsung Omnia 7 and it manages detecting the marker, showing the camera feed, rendering the 3d model and emulating a ZX Spectrum with sound and all at 25 fps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really impressed, imagine what we can do with compass and gyro.</p>
