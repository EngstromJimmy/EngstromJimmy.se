<p>With the release of Mango, the new OS upgrade for Windows Phone 7, it will be possible to create augmented reality applications.</p>
<p>Sadly the beta version of the mango update doesn&rsquo;t have drivers for the compass which kind of spoils most of the plans I had for augmented reality applications.</p>
<p>Then I realised maybe I could do something with the <a href="http://slartoolkit.codeplex.com/">SLARToolkit</a>. All the samples I could find used Silverlight (not a big surprise right?) no samples used the new XNA + Silverlight combination available in Windows Phone 7 so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m working on a ZX Spectrum Emulator for Windows Phone 7 I used a ZX Spectrum 3d model that I made a couple of years ago (maybe this feature will make it in to the emulator =) ).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an XNA superstar and this project really showed me that I need to read more About Matrix <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout" style="border-style: none;" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png" alt="Ler med tungan ute" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll blog later with some code samples.</p>
