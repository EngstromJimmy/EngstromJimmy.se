<p>Why you ask? Because it can be done&hellip; and therefore it should (?) <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout" style="border-style: none;" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout_3.png" alt="Ler med tungan ute" /></p>
<p>Since the resolution on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> is 256x192 pixels (not counting borders) and the resolution on the agent smartwatch is 128x128 pixels I had to make the screen smaller and as you can see from the image below, not really readable and as you might expect quite slow. <br />But the important part is: it works.</p>

<p>It only took me an evening to get this working, I really love the SDK and how well it works together with Visual Studio 2012.</p>
<p>This might be the best Christmas ever with both the Xbox One and Agent releasing around December, I can&rsquo;t wait =)</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the Agent Smartwatch, it is a smartwatch developed by Secret labs (the same guys who builds netduino) that runs .net Micro Framework.</p>
