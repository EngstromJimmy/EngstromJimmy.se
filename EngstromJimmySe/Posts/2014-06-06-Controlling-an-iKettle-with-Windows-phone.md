 <p>A week ago I found a kettle that can be controlled over Wi-fi.<br>
 It is called iKettle and can be found over <a href="http://www.wifikettle.com/">here</a>.</p> 
 <p>When I find a device I look for two things:<br>
 Is there an app for Windows (Phone or 8)? 
 <br>Can I make one?</p>
 <p>If the answer is yes to at least one of those questions (well actually none is ok too) I know I need to buy one.</p> 
 <p>Mark Cox had already done most of the heavy lifting so I only had to implement the protocol found on this <a href="http://www.awe.com/mark/blog/20140223.html">blog</a> (Thanks Mark).<br>I'm a bit sad that it didn't use http protocol, it could have replied with status 418 <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Ler" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-smile.png"></p> <p>There are still features missing, some because I haven't gotten around to it yet and some because there are hardware or software limitations, like you won't be able to set up the iKettle from a Windows phone since you can't connect directly to it.<br><br></p>
