<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>For Christmas 2 years ago my mother-in-law got me a Silverlit Bluetooth car.</p>
<p>Sadly it was a MFI device (Made for iPhone) and it seems to be more or less impossible to connect to an MFI-device without an iPhone (if someone has more info on this please let me know).</p>
<p>After talking to Silverlit, trying to convince them to share the protocol I got a <a href="http://silverlit.com/toy/interactive-bluetooth-rc-458-italia-for-android">Silverlit Ferrari 458 Italia (for android)</a> and managed to figure out how the protocol worked.</p>
<p>RC API is an open source project on <a href="https://rcapi.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a> which currently support controlling the Silverlit Ferrari 458 Italia from Windows 8.1 and Windows phone 8.</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>

<h3>The future</h3>
<p>I hope to be able to add more veichles and helicopters to the API, please let me know (or contribute) what you want me too add =D</p>
<p><br />If you are an RC device manufacturer and would like to include your device in the API, please let me know and I&rsquo;ll make it happen. <br />Making the API I have used inspiration from the <a href="https://legoev3.codeplex.com/">Lego EV3 codeplex project</a>, I liked how they solved Bluetooth communication and I decided to do it basically the same way.</p>
<p>Source code for RC API is available on <a href="https://rcapi.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a> and also available as a <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/RCAPI/">nuget</a> package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s bring more gadgets and RC-stuff to the Windows platforms =D</p>
