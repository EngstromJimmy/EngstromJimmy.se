<p>When connecting your Netduino to a LCD display you won&rsquo;t be able to du much more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll end up using almost all your connections, that really sucks.</p>
<p>Luckily there is a way to solve that by using a 8-bit shift register.</p>
<p>I found an <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/kobush/archive/2010/09/05/netmf_liquid_crystal.aspx">article</a> on how to connect it and decided to get mostly the same components (with a few exceptions since I don&rsquo;t have a backlight on my LCD).</p>
<p>Just like my last post there is no real value in describing how to do this since Szymon did a great job in the above mentioned article.</p>
