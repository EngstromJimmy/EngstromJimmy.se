Microsoft has really done some awesome stuff with the HoloLens and the tooling for developing for the HoloLens.   
I&#39;ve been developing for the HoloLens for a while now and one of the first thing I do when starting up a new project is making sure my HoloToolkit GIT clone is up to date and then copying the files to the right place.   
I wanted to make this process a little bit easier so I created an Azure script that automatically downloads the source and makes a Unity package out of it, every time something is checked in into the [HoloToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity) repo.   

You can get the HoloToolkit as a UnityPackage here:

Enjoy =)
