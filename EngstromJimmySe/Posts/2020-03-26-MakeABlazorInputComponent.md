Creating a reusable Blazor component can speed up development and makes it easier to avoid repeating your code.

In the Blazor framework, we have a bunch of really useful components for handling form data.
One of them is ```<InputText>``` it will render a ```<input>``` tag in the end.
But ```<InputText>``` will also add som classes depending on your form validation.

This is not going to be a deep-dive into form validation so at this point it's great if you are at least a little bit familiar with form validation.

Our component should be reusable and avoid having to repeat code.

I love ```DataAnnotations``` they make sure that the class itself takes control over the data.

Let's use a little more "advanced" sample to show you how powerful it can be.
Let's build a UI for changing a password.
It would have 3 different fields, old password, new password, and new password again (confirm password).

The class would look something like this.
