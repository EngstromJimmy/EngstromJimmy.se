<p>Here is my take on what is the most exciting products for the 2013 Christmas.<br />Some are available and some will be available early 2014, I mention these cause they are so awesome it could be worth the wait.<br />For those who know me, wait isn't what I do best so I feel your pain and I am sorry, I just had to include them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Lumia 1520</h3>
<p>6&rdquo; Screen, 20 MP camera, enough said =)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Xbox One</h3>
<p>If you live in a country that gets the Xbox One in the first batch, I guess it won't be on any Christmas list cause you already should have bought it :D<br />For those (like me) who live in a country that is not included in the first batch there might still be time to import one :)</p>
<h3><br />Lego Mindstorms EV3</h3>
<p>There is no age restrictions for Lego, this is a really awesome product.<br />It has motors, sensors and you can build almost anything.<br />The best part is that there is a .net library so you can build your own apps.</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>A micro computer that runs Linux. It has everything you might need, Ethernet, hdmi, USB, audio and controllable pins you can use to connect to other things.<br />Since it runs on Linux, Mono can be used to develop for it.</p>

<h3><br />Agent Smartwatch</h3>
<p>A wristwatch capable of running .net Micro framework code (how awesome is that?), much like the S.P.O.T watch back in the day.<br />As far as I understand they won't ship until after Christmas bit there is an SDK already available so start coding :)</p>

<h3><br />.NET Gadgeteer</h3>
<p>Speaking of .NET micro framework, this is a fast prototyping kit, that makes building basically any electronics really easy.<br />It has standardized connectors that means you don't have to know any electronics. It is really simple to get going.</p>

<h3><br />Myo</h3>
<p>A gesture controlled arm and, you can control your electronics by using gestures.<br />Becoming a Jedi is no longer a dream.<br />I have no idea how the development environment looks like, still want one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/">https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/</a></p>
<h3><br />Nymi</h3>
<p>It can use unique cardiac rhythm to authenticate your identity, allowing you to wirelessly take control of your computer, your smartphone, your car and so much more.</p>

<h3><br />Kinect 2 for Windows</h3>
<p>The new Kinect is even more sensitive than the first generation, it can even read your heartbeat *mind blown*.<br />I think wearable tech is the next big thing, but lets face it, tech you don't even have to wear is even cooler.</p>
<p><a title="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/</a> (this is still the old one)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Leap Motion</h3>
<p>All devices that makes it possible to control your computer is always fun.<br />The leap motion can track your fingers and also other objects like pens and such.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">https://www.leapmotion.com/</a></p>
<h3><br />Anki</h3>
<p>This is a racing track that connects to your iOS device (iPhone/iPad) using Bluetooth, the cars will drive around that track themselves but you control speed, lane and weapons. Yes weapons.<br />Real cars and real track but software shields and weapons *bummer*.<br />All the logic is in the iOS app and you can "upgrade" the cars with shields and new weapons.<br />If you shoot a car it will derail.<br />Very cool stuff so if you have an iPhone or iPad this is probably the must by Christmas gift this year.</p>

<p>If you don't find anything on the list or if you have a husband or wife that share my love for not waiting (eg already have or have ordered most of this stuff) you might consider printing your own.</p>
<h3><br />3D Printer</h3>
<p>There are many 3D printer out there. I like the cube 2, it is small and so is (sadly) the printing size. But it is large enough, the alternatives (having a reeeeally large one) isn't that appealing.<br />If you have trouble convincing your wife about a 3D printer, show her that it is possible to print chocolate :P<br />Besides that, Windows 8.1 has build in support for 3D Printers.</p>
