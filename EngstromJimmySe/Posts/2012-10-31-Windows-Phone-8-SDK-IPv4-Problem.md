<p>I ran into&nbsp;trouble the first time i launched the emulator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xde could'nt find an IPv4 address for the host machine&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my case the problem was: I had a Cisco VPN network adapter that was disconnected (since I wasn&rsquo;t connected to a VPN at the time).</p>
<p>Uninstalling Cisco VPN solved the issue for me (and another guy that had the same problem).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps anyone running into the same problem.</p>
