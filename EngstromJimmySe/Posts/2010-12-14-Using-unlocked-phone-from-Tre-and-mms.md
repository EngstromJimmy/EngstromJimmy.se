<p>Update: Samsung just released an update for there network tool, read more <a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/samsung-updates-omnia-7-network-tool-to-fix-mms-issue/">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a Samsung Omnia 7 from TRE in Sweden, after unlocking the phone (Since I have a work phone I couldn&rsquo;t switch to TRE) I couldn&rsquo;t get MMS to work.</p>
<p>TRE had somehow locked the ability to change Network profile and the application supplied by Samsung didn&rsquo;t do the trick.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextbestgeek.com/2010/12/12/samsung-no-mms-read-on/">Next Best Geek</a> has finally found a solution, an application that can solve the problem (I have tested and it works).</p>
<p>However you&rsquo;ll need a developer licence to be able to deploy the application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install the application use &ldquo;Application Deployment&rdquo; (From the Windows Phone SDK) point to the file and deploy it to your phone.</p>
